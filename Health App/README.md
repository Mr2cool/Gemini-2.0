# BazAI: Personalized Health Recommendation App

BazAI is a personalized exercise recommendation app designed to suggest appropriate physical activities based on your personal details—such as your name, height, weight, and current emotional state. The app calculates your Body Mass Index (BMI) and determines the recommended exercise intensity. Additionally, if you provide a Gemini API key, BazAI fetches extra health tips using the Gemini‑2.0‑flash‑exp model.
